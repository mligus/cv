intro:
  - I am a Data Engineer with 10+ years of experience in software engineering. During this period I had the luck to lead amazing engineering teams - small and large, distributed and localized. I have been designing, implementing and supporting Analytics, Data Warehousing, and other data-intensive large-scale systems from the requirements stage to production.
  - My extensive experience in performing pre-sale engagements with follow-up discovery and implementation phases helped multiple clients to achieve their business goals in the most optimal way.
  - I love Python, SQL and big data techs. And I believe that the best solutions lay in between, so be constantly learning is my credo.
